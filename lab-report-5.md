## Week 9 Lab Report 5

#### Part 1: Lab Report 3 Using Find Command

My favorite lab report that I did this quarter was lab report 3, which was the exploration of different ways you can execute a certain command. I chose to use the find command, as that was the one command that I felt would be the most useful to me going forward in the course, however, I do wish that I took the time to learn more about other commands, which is why I chose this lab report to relook at.

##### How I did the task:

I began by searching up different ways to use the find command – looking for directories, empty files, names of files, etc. – and used a cloned repository to test the outputs of the commands in the terminal. I also cited each of the websites that I learned the command from or learned more in-depth about what the command does. Finally I wrote descriptions of the output of each of the commands, as well as what it was doing to the directories, providing images to visualize the outputs.

##### Going forward:

In this lab I hope to research more about other commands, such as grep, rm, and , so that I can get a better understanding of different terminal commands I can call to search through and navigate my directories and files.



rm -r (remove non-empty file)
rmdir (remove a directory)


sudo ??
