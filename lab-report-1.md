## Week 1 Lab Report - Tutorial
#### Step 1: Installing VS Studio Code

To install Visual Studio Code on my pc, I followed the download and installation instructions on the [webite](https://code.visualstudio.com/)<br> for my respective pc type, Mac OSX. After installing and opening the app, my screen appeared as the image below.

*Note: Depending on your individual pc system and settings, the colors may differ than what's shown in the image above.*

#### Step 2: Remotely Connecting

To connect to a remote computer, I first began by oepning a new terminal and typing in ssh cse15lwi23***zz***@ieng6.ucsd.edu (be sure to replace ***zz*** with your own personal account info, in my case I replaced ***zz*** with ***abz***, so my command appeared in the terminal as ssh cse15lwi23***abz***@ieng6.ucsd.edu). A message will pop up prompting you to choose yes or no, type yes and continue by entering your password. The remote connection should be set up and your terminal should look similar to the image shown below.

*Use CTRL-D to log-out of remote server.*

#### Step 3: Trying Some Commands

Now that VS Code is installed and the remote connection has been set up, running some test commands in the terminal will be good practice for getting used to the syntax and how the program works. I began by typing the command ls -lat which printed a list of all the files in the current directory, including hidden files, and lists these files in order of when they were last modified, starting from the newest file. The output that showed in my terminal can be seen in the image below:

*Other commands include cd (change directory), pwd (print working directory), mkdir (make a new directory)*
