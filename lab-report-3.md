Example 2: <br>

In these examples I used the find -name command in order to find the file with the specific name in the specified directory to search, which in this case is the written_2 directory. This command is important as it can allow specific full pathways to be found for certain files, saving time and effort into looking for it individually.

##### Find -empty

Example 1: <br>

Example 2: <br>

In these examples I used the find -empty command to find the empty files within the specified directory, which was written_2. To show the output I first created an empty file called grep-results.txt, which was shown in the output of the first example since it was an empty file. However after removing the file, calling the find -empty command had no output, as all of the files within written_2 had some content in them. This is important as it can make sorting through files easier when wanting to remove excess files with no data or content in them, so people can clean their directories and file space.
